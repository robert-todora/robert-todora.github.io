The first post of my new series called game of the week. It's a simple concept really, I randomly pick out a game from my video game collection, and then over the course of the week I play the game, and then give it a review. This week's game is one that I unfortunately bought into the hype for right as the xbox 360 store was shutting down late last year, and I forked out about 70 dollars for a complete copy of the game, including the poster. Was it worth the cost?... 

Nope.

# The Review: 

It is really hard to rate this game positively because it just has so many problems. From really bad performance running on the xbox 360 to clunky aiming controls, and a really dumb story overall. Yet I found myself still charmed by this game. The abilities you get to use - including summoning a massive tornado or lightning bolts to decimate a tank, are really fun to use and give you a sense of true power. The enemies, while only about four or five different types, have unique designs and make the game stand out. Besides these two things though, the game is objectively bad, and I feel really stupid paying the amount I did for it on eBay for a physical copy. Oh well, at least the cover art is cool and it came with a poster.

2.5/5.0
